# Employee Tracker

## ‚úèÔ∏è Description:

With this project, I wanted to created a command line application that the CEO, management, or other data entry jobs could use for keeping track of their employees and their roles. This application allows the user to add employees, departments, and new roles. The user can also view these tables at any time using 'View All Departments', 'View All Roles', 'View All Employees'. The user also has the ability to update an employee role. This app will save the user a lot of time as all the information is in one place, and it should make data entry a breeze!
